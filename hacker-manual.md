## üåÄ Philosophy

*Build for Impact, Not Just Bounties*

### **Tech-Agnostic Building**: Empowering open innovation

While most hackathons prioritize short-term wins, we‚Äôre here to foster real-world, self-sustaining privacy solutions. Projects are judged not just on technical merit, but also on business logic, real-world use cases, and long-term impact‚Äîensuring your work lives on well beyond the event.

Our tracks are tech-, chain-, and protocol-agnostic. No forced stacks. No vendor agendas. You‚Äôre free to choose the best tools for your vision, without being boxed in by bounty-driven constraints.


### Collaboration over competition
Collaborate with designers, engineers, marketers, and researchers, while gaining direct access to independent industry mentors. 
Work on meaningful open-source tools and create lasting, impactful change.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hackathon Tracks

1. Advanced Cryptography
2. Censorship Resistance
3. Applied Encryption
4. Privacy-First AI
5. Public Goods
6. Design (UI/UX)
7. User Onboarding 


### 1. Advanced Cryptography
Cryptography is the backbone of digital security and privacy, powering everything we do. As an academic field it is constantly evolving and advances in this field can be difficult to understand or implement.

This track evolves around utilising advanced cryptographic tools within new use cases:
  - MPC (Multi-Party Computation)
  - TEE (Trusted Execution Environments)
  - ZK (Zero Knowledge proofs)
  - DID (Decentralised Identity protocols)
  - FHE (Fully homomorphic encryption)

### 2. Applied Encryption
How can we practically strengthen the cryptography behind the tools and services people rely on today? 

Enhance existing projects, revive abandoned ones, and apply new logic to proven encryption models.

Examples:
  - Encrypt hidden messages within music (carnation.fm)
  - Investigating and flagging privacy technologies using outdated cryptographic libraries
  - Rejuvenating sunset projects with outdated cryptography
  - Improving encryption standards for Post-Quantum Resistance
  - Create a privacy/encryption-focused CRM system
  - Add Threshold or Multi-signature schemes in single-sig wallets
  - Adding double-ratchet or modern encryption protocols to applications
  - plausible deniability: designated-verifier proofs in verifiable credentials

### 3. Censorship Resistance
Build or empower protocols and networks that protect users and content against digital censorship by outside parties.

Example Technology Stacks:
  - Tor Browser
  - i2p
  - mixnets (0KN, HOPR, Katzenpost, Nym, xx.network)
  - Nostr
  - Fileverse
  - DarkFi
  - Aztec
  - BitTorrent
  - Mesh networks (Reticulum / Meshtastic)
  - Bluetooth mesh networks
  - Adding privacy to current p2p protocols

### 4. Privacy-first AI
As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it is important that we can interact with it in the best possible way. User's right to privacy should be respected from all perspectives and by default.

Focus Areas:
 - Protect personal files while giving AI access to your codebase
 - Utilise AI systems on sensitive information securely
 - Censorship-resistant LLMs / AI models
 - Build applications that utilise anonymous datasets
 - Disrupt AI facial recognition systems

### 5. Public Goods
How can we protect individual privacy while enabling real-world impact and public infrastructure? This track invites builders to create privacy-preserving solutions that enhance compliance, aid, and coordination‚Äîespecially where traditional systems fail.

Focus Areas:
- Privacy-first aid & payments ‚Üí Tools for funding, verified recipients, merchants, and nonprofits‚Äîwithout exposing personal data or requiring government IDs.
- Identity for the underserved ‚Üí Privacy-preserving identity and civic tools for off-grid, stateless, or emerging communities.
- Privacy-preserving tools for public goods funding and governance ‚Üí Privacy-focused platforms for grants, voting, and coordination‚Äîsupporting collective action while protecting individual rights.

### 6. Design (UI/UX)
We frequently hear that privacy enhancing apps and platforms have "bad UI/UX" and that they are not welcoming to new users in a friendly way. 

This track seeks to encourage designers, marketers, and developers to improve application general look-n-feel.

Prototype quickly by re-using Figma files of real products:
- https://www.deepwork.network/case-studies (Explore similar projects and copy-paste design elements)

Ready to copy and paste designs for your app:
- http://lottecss.com (no need to apply classes, use with your semantic html/jsx markup, minimal (familiar) utility classes so you don't need tailwind)

### 7. User Onboarding
Privacy-focused applications often suffer from proper onboarding process for new users. This track seeks to enhance the new user experience.

Focus areas:
- Improving in-app onboarding process
- Improving app and website accessibility (WC3 standards)
- Curation of "2025 cryptographic best practices" for web3 wallet devs
- Review of the current e2e landscape in chat and social media
- Creating video guides for protocols

## ‚öñÔ∏è Judging Criteria

**Total: 100 points (20 points each criteria)**

> "Our judges will prioritise technical solutions and reward hackers not just about a working Proof of Concept application or good business logic in their pitch. Judges will assess the impact of what the team or person has done during the course of the hackathon."

### 1. Technology (20 points)
 - Was the technology stack used in the submission modern or exciting?
 - Was the submission aligned with modern web/coding practices?
 - Could you see developers within the ecosystems of the technologies used being excited by the submission?
 - Would you run this code?
 - Would you integrate this code into one of your projects?
 - Would you be interested in forking and improving this code (intention)
 - Does it compile? Have you managed to test-run it?
 - Are there real technological or physical constraints of the submission ("it would boil all the world's oceans")

### 2. Real-Use Cases (20 points)
 - Could you see yourself running this code if fully developed after the hackathon?
 - Could you see normies using the submission?
 - Could you see this positively impacting the lives of everyday users?
 - Could you see this positively impacting the lives of people/communities at risk?
 - Does this have a real world use case or is it only an intersting idea?

### 3. Privacy Improvement (20 points)
 - Does it improve privacy somehow?
 - Does it massively improve privacy?
 - Can you see ways it could further improve the privacy?
 - Does the submission consider web2 and web1 privacy leaking in the submission? 
 - Would you use this submission if your life depended on it working privately?

### 4. Business-logic (20 points)
 - Would a VC back this?
 - Is this already in the market?
 - Could you see privacy respecting revenue creation from this submission?
 - Did the person consider or present ideas about financial sustainability?
 - Would you think this submission could make it to the market and be used by users in an AppStore ecosystem?
 
### 5. Vibe (20 points)
This track is a wildcard 20 points judges can attribute as they see fit, not a judgement on the drip or flex of the person submitting, and definately not a vibe-check. Keeping it fun and giving the judge a 'open vote' where they can give anywhere from 0 or 20 points.
